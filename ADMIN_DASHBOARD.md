## Access Control

### Authentication
- Protected routes require admin privileges
- In development mode, admin routes are accessible for demo purposes
- Production deployment should implement proper authentication

### Role-Based Access

- Regular users: No access to admin routes
- Unauthenticated users: Redirected to sign-in page

## Technical Implementation

### Routes Structure
```
/admin                          # Main dashboard
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /equipment                  # Equipment list
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /new                   # Add new equipment
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /[id]/edit            # Edit existing equipment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /images                    # Image management
```

### Components
- `ProtectedRoute`: Handles authentication and authorization
- `EquipmentFormClient`: Comprehensive form for equipment data

- `EquipmentManagerClient`: Equipment listing and operations

### Key Features
1. **Form Validation**: Required fields and data type validation
2. **Image Upload**: Support for multiple images with size and type validation
3. **Dynamic Fields**: Add/remove specifications and features
4. **Search & Filter**: Real-time search and category filtering
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
6. **State Management**: Local state for real-time updates

## Usage Instructions

### Adding New Equipment
1. Navigate to `/admin/equipment/new`
2. Fill in basic information (name, manufacturer, price, etc.)
3. Upload images using drag-and-drop or file selection
4. Add specifications (key-value pairs)
5. Add features (list of capabilities)
6. Save the equipment

### Editing Equipment
1. Go to `/admin/equipment`
2. Find the equipment and click "Edit"
3. Modify any information
4. Update images as needed
5. Save changes

### Managing Images
1. Visit `/admin/images`
2. Switch between grid and list views
3. Select images for bulk operations
4. View usage information for each image
5. Delete unused or unwanted images

## Development Notes

### Mock Data
Currently uses mock data from `lib/equipment.ts`. In production, replace with actual API calls.

### Image Storage
Images are currently handled with mock URLs. Implement actual file upload to cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.) for production.

### API Integration
The forms currently log data to console. Implement actual API endpoints for:
- Creating equipment
- Updating equipment
- Deleting equipment
- Uploading images
- Managing image metadata

### Security Considerations
- Implement proper file upload validation
- Add CSRF protection
- Validate file types and sizes on server-side
- Implement proper error handling
- Add audit logging for admin actions

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Mobile responsive design
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Deployment
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` for production deployment
2. Implement proper authentication system
3. Configure cloud storage for images
4. Set up API endpoints for data persistence
5. Add proper error monitoring and logging
